<h1 align="center">Hi there 👋, I'm Jarosław Baumgart</h1>
## About Me

Hey! I’m Jarosław — a passionate Fullstack Developer with a background in Automation and Robotics Engineering from Poznań University of Technology and Electronics Technician certification from the Electronic Schools Complex in Bydgoszcz.

I worked for a year as a programmer-automation engineer at IPS Control, where I gained valuable hands-on experience in industrial automation and software integration.

Early on, I combined hardware and software interests, which led me to programming and building innovative projects. For example, my project for the 2017 Technical Innovation and Invention Olympiad was a mobile solar tracker that follows the sun's position to maximize energy efficiency — this won me 3rd place in the competition.

Nowadays, I focus on building scalable web applications using React, TypeScript, Node.js, MongoDB, and MySQL. I believe in clean code, continuous learning, and sharing knowledge with the community.

Outside of coding, I’m deeply interested in automotive technologies, cars, and mechanics. I enjoy designing and creating custom standalone car computers — merging my passion for software with hands-on mechanical projects.

I always enjoy ambitious challenges that push my limits and help me grow both personally and professionally.

My coding philosophy? Hard work beats talent when talent doesn’t work hard. I’m always pushing myself to learn new technologies and improve.

I’m excited to collaborate on meaningful projects, grow as a developer, and contribute to impactful software.

Feel free to reach out if you want to connect or discuss ideas!
